Launching something new is hard. Spending months creating a product, arguing over features, trying to decide what our potential customers will prefer. Finally, it's "ready". Who are we kidding? It's never ready. It's never done. But at some point we have to decide that it's "good enough" to see the light of day.

The ever-present fear that people will hate it. That they'll sign up, and some problem will happen, and they'll decide that they want their money back. Of course, the real danger is that actually no-one will visit us at all. That after all our effort, it'll sink without trace and no-one will even look at it.

There's a feeling of "sod it, let's just do it!", like jumping off a high diving board. We climbed up all these steps, we're going to look like idiots if we don't actually jump. Friends and family keep asking about when we're launching. At some point we need to have something better to say than "soon...".

But there's all the things we know we need to fix, but haven't got around to yet. The features that don't quite work in some cases. The bits of styling that look horrible. How it all slows down if you do this to it. We see all the problems, and none of the good bits. How is anyone going to enjoy this when it's obviously so broken?

Staying with "we'll launch it soon" means we don't have to confront these. We can pretend we're going to fix all the broken bits. We can pretend it's going to go viral as soon as we launch, and we never have to confront our fears. We can keep redesigning things, arguing about features, trying to decide how this all works to make it perfect. Then we can launch. When it's perfect.

So. Here we are. Sorry it's so broken. There's a huge list of things that we're working on fixing. But that list has only got longer over the past year, not shorter. We're never going to finish it, it'll always get longer. So we decided to call this the point at which it's "good enough". We're sorry that it's not perfect.

But we need you to tell us what you like about it, and what you hate about it. We're going in loops trying to guess what works for you. So please tell us. If you find a broken bit, please tell us. If you want it to do something that it doesn't do yet, please tell us. We'd love to hear what you think of it, even if that's just "I hate it".

And if you do hate it, come back in a few months. We'll have fixed more stuff, and acted on your feedback. It'll be more what you want, and less what we thought you wanted.

Wish us luck, too. This is hard.
