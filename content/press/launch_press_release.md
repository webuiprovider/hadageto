**__Quick to set-up and simple to use, Hadageto is currently offering business customers a three-month free trial.__**  This will come as welcome news to those who need an instant and secure solution for sharing documents with customers and suppliers in order to maintain business continuity, without any initial financial outlay.

Hadageto has been developed by document management industry experts primarily for the SME sector as a very affordable subscription-based solution for the remote secure sharing and tracking of activity on important business documents between customers, suppliers and colleagues 24/7.

> “We are introducing this earlier than intended and we are being totally transparent in admitting there is some ongoing development work to enhance the service for an even better user-experience. We believe that even in its infancy, the Hadageto service will be invaluable to businesses, their customers and suppliers at this unprecedented time. The free three-month trial period means there is no initial cash outlay and no obligation to continue at the end of the trial. However, we are confident that once the benefits have been experienced, users will not want to be without Hadageto”

says Simon Ellis, Co-Founder – Hadageto UK Ltd, who has been responsible for launching many innovative services within the document management arena. 

The Hadageto platform provides total peace of mind through secure encryption of every document. This makes it suitable for sharing and receiving sensitive or confidential documents that should not be shared by standard email. For example, HR records, company financials, contracts, certificates, bank statements, tax returns, wills, ID documents and much more.

How does it work? 

• Upload a document; add one or more tags (#) to identify and categorise it.
• Tags provide powerful records management properties allowing you to set permissions, retentions and actions and retrieve related documents fast.
• Invite someone to have access (create a share – this results in the invitee registering for their own free account so ensuring transaction integrity).
• See documents added by clients and suppliers – They can only see what you have shared with them / allowed them to see.
• Track who saw what document, what they did to it and when that was. (Provides full GDPR activity compliance).
• Hadageto even manages your filing; create virtual folder views based on one or more tags.

Hadageto is an ideal document sharing solution for many types of small to medium sized business users. To register for a free three month trial, visit [hadageto.com ](https://hadageto.com) using this coupon code in the payment process ‘**staysafe**’.
